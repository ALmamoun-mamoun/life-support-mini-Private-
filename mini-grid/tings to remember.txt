UI = User Interface — the screen you use in your browser (buttons, text, lists).

In our setup, “UI” specifically means the Prospects web page:

Address: http://127.0.0.1:3005/prospects.html?guid=...

It’s the front-end: what you see and click.

It talks to the API (the backend on port 3001) through the proxy (port 3005).

Quick map:

UI → Prospects page in Chrome.

Proxy (3005) → middleman that serves the UI and forwards its requests.

API (3001) → the backend service.

Poller → background script that drains the event outbox (no screen).

So when I say “Open UI”, I mean: open the Prospects page in your browser (usually via your desktop launcher or that 3005 link with your GUID).
